# PingBing
down and dirty C# program to ping Bing and write response times to the console.  I wrote this to prove to my ISP that I was in fact having a problem.  To get data to plot on a graph I just piped the output to a file.  It would be easy to modify the code to write the output as CSV to a file or directly to a SQL Database using other examples in this repository.
